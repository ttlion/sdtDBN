# What is sdtDBN?

This website contains an overview on the main sdtDBN functionalities.

tDBN is a Java program that creates a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) from user multivariate longitudinal data, having polynomial time complexity in the number of attributes and observations. The complete implementation and functionalities of tDBN are publicly available [here](http://josemonteiro.github.io/tDBN/), being the Theorical background of tDBN explained in the following article:


>José L Monteiro, Susana Vinga, and Alexandra M Carvalho.
>Polynomial-time algorithm for learning optimal tree-augmented dynamic Bayesian networks.
>In UAI, pages 622–631, 2015. http://auai.org/uai2015/proceedings/papers/329.pdf


tDBN only allows learning a tDBN using dynamic data and does not allow to make inference on the created DBN. sdtDBN solves these issues, being an extension of tDBN to learn a DBN using both dynamic and static data and allowing the user to make inference on the learned DBN.

# Theoretical background of sdtDBN

sdtDBN was developed in the context of the Master's Thesis on Electrical and Computer Engineering of Tiago Leão, at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon. The Thesis is available at **Aqui por ou link dps para a tese ou link para eventual artigo que se escreva**, in which all theorical background of sdtDBN is explained.

# Current release and libraries

## Current release

The program is currently in version 0.0.1 and can be downloaded [here](https://google.com). The program comes in an executable jar and its usage is explained and exemplified in this webpage.

## External libraries

Just as tDBN, the sdtDBN implementation uses two external libraries:

- [opencsv](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) (for parsing CSV files);

- [Apache Commons CLI](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/) ( for parsing command line options)


# How to use the sdtDBN program?

## Program usage

The usage of the sdtDBN program can be found by running:

```
java -jar sdtDBN_v0.0.1.jar
```

Running the aforementioned command will produce the following usage of the program:

```

                                        time-slices. Default is 1,
                                        allowing edges from one preceding

                                        be a tree instead of a forest,
                                        eventually producing a structure
                                        with a lower score.
 -t,--trajectory <int>                  Timestep until which trajectory is

 -tf,--outputTrajectoryFile <file>      Writes predicted trajectories to
                                        <file>. If not supplied, output is
                                        written to terminal.

The usage for the arguments not in this list should be checked at the [tDBN webpage](http://josemonteiro.github.io/tDBN/).

## Input files formats

All input files must be given in comma-separated values (CSV) format.

### Files with dynamic attributes

All files with dynamic attributes should follow the following format:

- The first line should be the header, where the first value must be some identification tag and the remaining values should be each attribute name together with the proper timestep, in the form "attName__timestep"
  
- The order of the attributes and timesteps must conform to the following:
  - Each timestep must have all its attributes in consecutive positions
  - The order of the attributes must be the same in all timesteps
  - Example for two attributes and two timesteps: attNameX__0, attNameY__0, attNameX__1, attNameY__1

- In each of the remaining lines, the first position should be the subject identifier and the remaining positions must be the values of the attributes in the respective timesteps, in the order defined in the header line

- Missing values should be marked either by not writing anything or by putting "?"

- An example file with dynamic attributes is presented next. In this file, there are 2 attributes and 3 timesteps. There are missing values at subject 20 in "attX__2" and at subject 21 in "attY__1"

```
id,attX__0,attY__0,attX__1,attY__1,attX__2,attY__2
20,3,-1,8,0,?,3
21,4,2,3,,2,-8
```

#### Arguments that use dynamic attributes

- **-i**: This argument should be the file with the dynamic observations used to learn the DBN;

- **-obs**: This argument should be the file with dynamic observations of the subjects in which inference is going to be made.


### Files with static attributes

All files with static attributes should follow the following format:

- The first line should be the header, where the first value must be some identification tag and the remaining values should be each attribute name.
  - It is important for the user to guarantee that a subject in the static file exists in the dynamic file (with the same id).
    - Subjects in **-is** file should exist in **-i** file.
    - Subjects in **-obsStatic** file should exist in **-obs**.
    - There may be subjects on the dynamic files not in the respective static files, but the opposite cannot be true!

- In each of the remaining lines, the first position should be the subject identifier and the remaining positions must be the values of the static attributes, in the order defined in the header line

- Missing values should be marked either by not writing anything or by putting "?"

- An example file with static attributes is presented next. In this file, there are 4 attributes. There are missing values at subject 20 in "attC" and at subject 21 in "attW"

```
id,attA,attC,attD,attW
20,A,,e,0
21,B,2,4,?
```

#### Arguments that use static attributes

- **-is**: This argument should be the file with the static observations used to learn the DBN. If not given, program will learn a tDBN, without static features. If given, program will learn a sdtDBN, with static and dynamic features;

- **-obsStatic**: This argument should be the file with static observations of the subjects in which inference is going to be made.

### File with variables and respective timesteps to make inference

The file with static attributes should follow the following format:

- There must be two values per line, separated by ","
  - The first value should be the dynamic attribute name
  - The second value should be the timestep

- All attributes names specified in this file must exist in the dynamic attributes files. The timesteps may not exist in the dynamic attributes files, in that case values will be predicted until the specified timestep, according to the learned network structure.

- An example file where the program would do inference for attX\[2\] and attY\[3\] is presented next.

```
attX,2
attY,3
```

#### Argument with variables and respective timesteps to make inference

- **-inf**: This argument should be the file with variables and respective timesteps to make inference.

## Illustrative examples

### Example 1 - Learning a DBN with dynamic and static attributes

This example focus only on the learning component of the program, introducing how to learn a DBN also with static attributes. 

The files used for this example are the following:

- [example1_dynamic.csv](example1_dynamic.csv): The file with dynamic attributes for learning
- [example1_static.csv](example1_static.csv): The file with static attributes for learning

To learn a sdtDBN with markovLag = 1, a maximum of 1 dynamic parent from the previous timeslice and a maximum of 1 static parent, the following command can be run:

```
java -jar tdbn.jar -i example1_dynamic.csv -is example1_static.csv -p 1 -s ll -m 1 -b 1
```

The output obtained is:

```
Evaluating network with LL score.
Number of networks with max score: 18
Finding a maximum branching.
Network score: -2.772588722239781

-----------------

b[0] -> a[1]
a[0] -> b[1]

b[1] -> a[1]

x -> a[1]
z -> b[1]
```

To obtain a graphical representation, the argument "-d" can be used, just as in the tDBN framework, as illustrated next:

```
java -jar tdbn.jar -i example1_dynamic.csv -is example1_static.csv -p 1 -s ll -m 1 -b 1 -d | dot -Tpng -o fig_example1.png
```

would output the following graph:


![Image](fig_example1.png)

To learn the parameters of the created DBN, the argument -pm can be used:

```
java -jar tdbn.jar -i example1_dynamic.csv -is example1_static.csv -p 1 -s ll -m 1 -b 1 -pm
```

would obtain:


```
Evaluating network with LL score.
Number of networks with max score: 18
Finding a maximum branching.
Network score: -2.772588722239781

-----------------

b[0] -> a[1]
a[0] -> b[1]

b[1] -> a[1]

x -> a[1]
z -> b[1]


a: [0.0, 1.0]
[x=1.0, b[0]=0.0, b[1]=0.0]: 1.000 0.000
[x=0.0, b[0]=0.0, b[1]=0.0]: 0.000 1.000
[x=1.0, b[0]=1.0, b[1]=0.0]: 0.000 1.000
[x=1.0, b[0]=0.0, b[1]=1.0]: 0.500 0.500
[x=0.0, b[0]=1.0, b[1]=0.0]: 1.000 0.000
[x=0.0, b[0]=0.0, b[1]=1.0]: 1.000 0.000
[x=1.0, b[0]=1.0, b[1]=1.0]: 0.500 0.500
[x=0.0, b[0]=1.0, b[1]=1.0]: 0.000 1.000

b: [0.0, 1.0]
[z=1.0, a[0]=0.0]: 0.000 1.000
[z=0.0, a[0]=1.0]: 1.000 0.000
[z=0.0, a[0]=0.0]: 1.000 0.000
[z=1.0, a[0]=1.0]: 0.500 0.500
```

### Example 2 - Inference of specific attributes on a learned DBN with dynamic and static attributes

Following the DBN learned in example 1, inference can be made in that DBN. In this example, it is explained how to do inference on a specific attribute at a specific timestep.

The files used for this example are the following:

- [example1_dynamic.csv](example1_dynamic.csv): The file with dynamic attributes for learning
- [example1_static.csv](example1_static.csv): The file with static attributes for learning
- [example2_dynamic_inf.csv](example2_dynamic_inf.csv): The file with the dynamic observations of the subjects where inference is to be made
- [example2_static_inf.csv](example2_static_inf.csv): The file with the static observations of the subjects where inference is to be made
- [example2_infVars.csv](example2_infVars.csv): The file with the dynamic attributes and respective timesteps where the user desires to make inference for the given subjects

When making inference, one of two options can be selected with the argument **-infFmt**:

- **-infFmt mostProb**: This mode will present, for each attribute\[timestep\] where inference was defined (file example2_dynamic_inf), the most probable value for each subject specified (files example2_static_inf and example2_infVars).

- **-infFmt distrib**: This mode will present, for each attribute\[timestep\] where inference was defined (file example2_dynamic_inf), the conditional distribution of the learned network, for each subject specified (files example2_static_inf and example2_infVars).

If there are cases where inference is not possible because the parent nodes values are not given in the observations files and cannot be determined by the model, the program will inform that inference is not possible on those specific cases.

If specifying **-infFmt mostProb**, the following command line should be inserted:

```
java -jar tdbn.jar -i example1_dynamic.csv -is example1_static.csv -p 1 -s ll -m 1 -b 1 -obs example2_dynamic_inf.csv -obsStatic example2_static_inf.csv -inf example2_infVars.csv -infFmt mostProb
```

getting the following output:

```
Evaluating network with LL score.
Number of networks with max score: 18
Finding a maximum branching.
Network score: -2.772588722239781

-----------------

b[0] -> a[1]
a[0] -> b[1]

b[1] -> a[1]

x -> a[1]
z -> b[1]


id,a[1],a[3],b[4],b[1]
1,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3,null,0.0,1.0,1.0
```

If specifying **-infFmt distrib**, the following command line should be inserted:

```
java -jar tdbn.jar -i example1_dynamic.csv -is example1_static.csv -p 1 -s ll -m 1 -b 1 -obs example2_dynamic_inf.csv -obsStatic example2_static_inf.csv -inf example2_infVars.csv -infFmt distrib
```

getting the following output:

```
Evaluating network with LL score.
Number of networks with max score: 18
Finding a maximum branching.
Network score: -2.772588722239781

-----------------

b[0] -> a[1]
a[0] -> b[1]

b[1] -> a[1]

x -> a[1]
z -> b[1]


Distributions a[1]:
id,0.0,1.0
1,1.000,0.000
2,1.000,0.000
3,-1,-1

Distributions a[3]:
id,0.0,1.0
1,0.500,0.500
2,1.000,0.000
3,0.500,0.500

Distributions b[4]:
id,0.0,1.0
1,0.000,1.000
2,1.000,0.000
3,0.000,1.000
```

If wanting the output of the inference to written to a specific file, the user only needs to give the file to be created in the **-outInf** argument. For example:

```
java -jar tdbn.jar -i example1_dynamic.csv -is example1_static.csv -p 1 -s ll -m 1 -b 1 -obs example2_dynamic_inf.csv -obsStatic example2_static_inf.csv -inf example2_infVars.csv -infFmt distrib -outInf outputExample2.csv
```

would write the previous inference output to the newly created file [outputExample2.csv](outputExample2.csv).


### Example 3 - Getting the most probable trajectory

Also following the DBN learned in example 1, it is now explained in this example how the user can determine the most probable trajectory of all attributes until a certain timestep, given certain observations of subjects.

The files used for this example are the following:

- [example1_dynamic.csv](example1_dynamic.csv): The file with dynamic attributes for learning
- [example1_static.csv](example1_static.csv): The file with static attributes for learning
- - [example2_dynamic_inf.csv](example2_dynamic_inf.csv): The file with the dynamic observations of the subjects where inference is to be made
- [example2_static_inf.csv](example2_static_inf.csv): The file with the static observations of the subjects where inference is to be made

To get the mentioned trajectories, the user only needs to define the maximum timestep in the argument **-t**. For example, if the user wants to determine the most probable trajectory of all attributes until timestep 5, the following command can be inserted:

```
java -jar tdbn.jar -i example1_dynamic.csv -is example1_static.csv -p 1 -s ll -m 1 -b 1 -obs example2_dynamic_inf.csv -obsStatic example2_static_inf.csv -t 5
```

Which will output:

```
Evaluating network with LL score.
Number of networks with max score: 18
Finding a maximum branching.
Network score: -2.772588722239781

-----------------

b[0] -> a[1]
a[0] -> b[1]

b[1] -> a[1]

x -> a[1]
z -> b[1]


id,a__0,b__0,a__1,b__1,a__2,b__2,a__3,b__3,a__4,b__4,a__5,b__5
1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
2,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
3,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
```

As can be seen in b\[0\] and a\[1\] of subject 3, the program simply does not provide any estimations where those estimations cannot be given (if the parent nodes are not specified in the observations and cannot be determined by the model).

If wanting the output of the most probable trajectories to be written to a specific file, the user only needs to give the file to be created in the **-tf** argument. For example:

```
