# What is sdtDBN?

This website contains an overview on the main sdtDBN functionalities.

tDBN is a Java program that creates a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) from user multivariate longitudinal data, having polynomial time complexity in the number of attributes and observations. The complete implementation and functionalities of tDBN are publicly available [here](http://josemonteiro.github.io/tDBN/), being the Theorical background of tDBN explained in the following article:

```
José L Monteiro, Susana Vinga, and Alexandra M Carvalho.
Polynomial-time algorithm for learning optimal tree-augmented dynamic Bayesian networks.
In UAI, pages 622–631, 2015. [http://auai.org/uai2015/proceedings/papers/329.pdf](http://auai.org/uai2015/proceedings/papers/329.pdf)
```

tDBN only allows learning a tDBN using dynamic data and does not allow to make inference on the created DBN. sdtDBN solves this issues, being an extension of tDBN to learn a DBN using both dynamic and static data and allowing the user to make inference on the learned DBN.

# Theoretical background of sdtDBN

sdtDBN was developed in the context of the Master's Thesis on Electrical and Computer Engineering of Tiago Leão, at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon. The Thesis is available at **Aqui por ou link dps para a tese ou link para eventual artigo que se escreva**, in which all theorical background of sdtDBN is explained.

# Program release and libraries

## Current release

The program is currently in version 0.0.1 and can be downloaded [here](https://google.com). The program comes in an executable jar and its usage is explained and exemplified i in this webpage.

## Libraries

Just as tDBN, the sdtDBN implementation uses two external libraries:

- opencsv (for parsing CSV files);

- Apache Commons CLI ( for parsing command line options)


# How to use the sdtDBN program?

## Program usage

The usage of the sdtDBN program can be found by running:

```
java -jar sdtDBN_v0.0.1.jar
```

Running the aforementioned command will produce the following usage of the program:

```

                                        allowing edges from one preceding
